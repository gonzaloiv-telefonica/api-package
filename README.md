The project contains a sample folder with two requests:
1. The first script (PostmanSample.cs) calls to a Postman mock server (Metaverse-Virtual-Store-Oculus/RestServer).
2. The second script (Shopify.cs) calls to a testing Shopify shop(https://my-meta-store.myshopify.com/, password: abc123.0).

3. SimpleGraphQL: https://openupm.com/packages/com.lastabyss.simplegraphql/#close
